# Organize Files in Subfolders

This is a Quick Action that automatically arranges files into designated subfolders based on their filenames. This is particularly useful for quickly organizing files without the need for manual sorting.

## How It Works

Files named following the pattern "FOLDER#filename" will be automatically relocated to a new or existing folder named "FOLDER" and will be renamed to simply "filename". This process is applicable to subfolders as well.

### Example

A file named `FOLDER1#file.wav` will be moved to a new or existing folder titled `FOLDER1` and renamed to `file.wav`.

## Installation Guide

3. Enjoy organizing your files more efficiently!
